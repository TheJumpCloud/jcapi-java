## JCAPI-Python

### Description

This repository contains the Java client code for the JumpCloud API v1 and v2.
It also provides the tools to generate the client code from the API yaml files, using swagger-codegen.
For detailed instructions on how to generate the code, see the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) section.

### Installing the Java Client

### Authentication and Authorization

All endpoints support authentication via API key: see the [Authentication and Authorization](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/2.0/authentication-and-authorization/authentication-and-authorization-overview) section in our API docs.

Some Systems endpoints (in both API v1 and v2) also support the [System Context authorization](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/2.0/authentication-and-authorization/system-context) which allows an individual system to manage its information and resource associations.

### Usage Examples

For more detailed instructions, refer to each API's respective README file ([README for API v1](jcapiv1/README.md) and [README for API v2](jcapiv2/README.md)) and the generated docs under each folder.
